	<h1 id="what">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<img src="http://dh.unl.edu/DHSticker3x3RoundRGB_300.png" id="dhn">
	<h1 id="what3">What can you do with DH?</h2>
	<p id="what4">There are so many things you can do with DH! you can build archives that collect data pertaining to any subject you have interest in. You can build three-dimensional reconstructions of various cities, buildings, or landscapes. You can build programs that run analyses of text in novels and compare them to something else, like the author's autobiography or something of the like. There is still so much more that can be done in DH research. This is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
	<h1 id="what3"> I'm a humanities student. I'm intimidated. Can I still do this software stuff?</h2>
	<p id="what4">Absolutely. This is why we have introductory courses to DH here at UNL. These courses intend to teach you the basics of coding, so you at least have a basic understanding of what the technological aspects involve. Many students who enter DH have no idea how and where to begin when it comes to computer programming. That is perfectly acceptable. We are all here to learn, some of us at different points in the learning process.</p>
	<p id="what4">It is also perfectly okay to not even begin to learn computer coding if it scares you. Much of DH projects is collaboration. Should you be interested in developing your own project, you can always invite computer programmers to join your project team. You can always learn through them to have a better understanding of what they are doing and what your project itself is trying to accomplish.</p>
	<h1 id="what3">What have graduates gone on to do?</h2>
	<p id="what4">When it comes to education in DH, there are lots of things to consider. Here as undergraduates, we have a broader understanding of what DH is. Typically, many students go on to get advanced degrees in a variety of fields. Some go into web design, some go into library and information science, and some simply continue in their humanities academic field. The point of DH studies is to give you a better understanding of an existing humanities field. You can apply it however you desire.</p>
	<p id="what4">In regards to jobs, again, there are also lots of options regarding career fields. Graduates from UNL specifically have gone into libraries, education, technical communication, and computer science, to name a few. A few students have even gone on to work for major institutions, such as the Library of Congress and Apple.</p>
	<h1 id="what3">How will a DH focus enhance my learning focus?</h2>
	<p id="what4">We cannot stress this enough: DH studies seek to enhance knowledge of text, print, and other humanities studies through new digital means. By engaging in DH research, you are obtaining a more in-depth analysis of a topic that could not be done through traditional research methods. DH adds a new dimension to every learning environment. It does not necessarily aim to answer all the questions, but to answer those that require digital textual analyses or different digital perspectives.</p> 
	<h1 id="what3">Where can I do graduate work?</h2>
	<p id="what4">The first thing you need to consider before pursuing graduate studies is what exactly you want to study. If it is specifically DH you are interested in, some universities offer graduate certificates specifically in DH. Some of the best programs include <a href="https://cesta.stanford.edu/programs/graduate-programs/graduate-certificate-digital-humanities" id="wl">Stanford University</a>, the <a href="http://digitalhumanities.unc.edu/programs/gcpdh/" id="wl">University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill</a>, and of course, the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/dhcert/home" id="wl">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>.</p>
	<p id="what4">Many students also go on to their their master's degrees in Library and Information Science. <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings" id="wl">This list</a> includes all of the best MLIS programs in the United States.</p>
	<h1 id="what3">What does the community gain from these projects?</h2>
	<p id="what4">Let us say this one more time: DH projects help enhance knowledge of text, print, and other humanities studies through new digital means. This means an increase of knowledge. We as humans have this desire to always be learning something new. It's just in our nature. DH projects allow this thirst for knowledge to be fulfilled. Certainly they are related to humanities topics, but those who are part of the creative process learn and produce so much more. The community, and those involve, get a new learning perspective on subjects they are interested in that they could not have learned as completely as with traditional research methods.</p>
