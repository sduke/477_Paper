<p>Digital Humanities: the new frontier to humanities research. Research projects cover a broad spectrum of concepts, ranging from three-dimensional reconstructions of historical sites (Virtual Williamsburg, Digital Augustan Rome) to literary archives containing the works, correspondences, and interviews of some of history’s most prominent authors (The Walt Whitman Archive, The Willa Cather Archive). These projects, more often than not, take years to develop. The question is: what is an ideal digital humanities project? What makes these projects tick?</p>

<p>A digital humanities project, in and of itself, is essentially a working program that seeks to discover new meaning, or a better understanding, in text, print, and other humanities through digital means. This could be through encoding, scanning, mapping, and other digital techniques. The first step in developing a digital humanities project is concept. What is it that you are trying to accomplish in your project? Are you building off of a previously existing project or research set, or are you coming up with a completely new idea? More often than not, digital humanities projects relate to something historical. Researchers then want to know why things are the way they are: what did people know years ago, and how can we learn and apply them to our lives now? These are just a few of the key questions to consider when beginning to develop a digital humanities project.</p>

<p>When the topic of the project has been decided on, the next step is more behind the scenes work. Who do you want to work on the project? What different types of people are needed to keep the project moving forward and make it the most comprehensive project possible? The best digital humanities projects often involve collaboration between people of several different disciplines. As defined by Jennifer Edmond in “Collaboration and Infrastructure,” the ideal digital humanities collaboration involves “cutting-edge technological development and deep analog scholarly knowledge challenging each others’ paradigms, facilitation each others’ work, and validating each others’ results.” Digital humanities is supposed to be interdisciplinary. This means that there should be a variety of different people coming together to work on one project together. It involves people with English backgrounds, with history backgrounds, with computer science backgrounds, sometimes even those with anthropologian backgrounds. The variety of different disciplines and experiences enables the project to have the best possible people work in the research fields they are most comfortable with.</p>

<p>Along the lines of collaboration, it is important to also include people of diverse backgrounds outside the field of academia. In other words, diverse cultures. Including women, international people, and people of various ethnicities allows the project to have viewpoints of all different walks of life, other than the predominantly white male viewpoint. Kim Gallon argues in her article “Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities” that the tension between humanity and the digital world is derived through a “’technology of recovery,’ characterized by efforts to bring forth the full humanity of marginalized peoples through the use of digital platforms and tools.” She is statesarguing that most of digital humanities is the act of recovery of lost literary and historical texts. These texts are supposed to be records of humanity, and so much of digital humanities right now is directed toward preserving white history. By incorporating a person of color on a digital humanities project, it allows for the research to involve viewpoints from two different cultural backgrounds, giving it a broader, more complete comprehension. The same goes for incorporating women in a digital humanities project. Computer and technical skills has always been a predominately male profession. It almost seems as if women are expected to do the humanities side of digital humanities rather than the hard technical work, or not be involved in the project at all. Like the incorporation of people of color, by including women in a digital humanities project, it will allow for broader, more in-depth interpretations due to the addition of the female viewpoint.</p>

<p>Now that the people who will be working on the project have been determined, the next step is to ensure that appropriate credit is given where it is due. Because there are so many people involved in the project, from the encoders to the photo editors to the publishers, not everyone works on the same thing the same amount of time, so they do not necessarily deserve the same amount of credit. Stephen Ramsay and Geoffrey Rockwell argue in their article “Developing Things: Notes toward an Epistemology of Building in the Digital Humanities” that the reason appropriate credit is an issue is due to the question of what scholarship is. Books with bibliographies are obviously scholarship, but digital bibliographic tools are not always considered scholarship, when many believe that they should be. This is why, when it comes to the project itself, it is important to include all the people that contributed to the scholarship. From the project manager all the way down to the person who scanned the document to forward to the project manager, they all contributed to the project, and it is important to make sure they receive the credit they deserve.</p>

<p>The biggest and most important thing to consider when developing a digital humanities project is preservation. You want to make sure that the project you have come up with and worked so hard on has a future. It should have both an audience who is interested in the topic, as well as live on an interface that has the potential to modulate as technology evolves. When projects are still in the developing phase, meaning that there is still data being added to them, it is obvious that preservation and adaptation are at the forefront of the project’s development. Those invested in the project have no desire to see all of their hard work vanish with a software update or coding change. The interfaces they use help ensure that the project lasts while they continue to develop it. The issue with preservation becomes an even greater priority after the project has been, essentially, “completed.” When no new information has been added to the project, it becomes seems almost like a chore to determine the topic's relevance.if it is still a relevant topic. Is there still a dedicated audience, is the information complete, have any new discoveries been made that would contradict the current evidence?. After one project has been completed, more than likely in the future a new project will stem from the old research and take it in a completely different direction. It makes sense, then, to keep the project at least mostly up to date, possibly updating code as needed with changing coding norms and rules, so that if anyone interested in the new branch of the project wanted to know where it originated from, they have the original project to refer to.</p>

<p>Digital humanities projects have many uses. They can be archives to keep records and databases of things pertaining to a specific author or era. They can by analytical, conducting studies on a particular written work, or time period, or series of events. They can be digital reconstructions of cities that have since been subjected to ruin. They can be tools used to further analyze projects that already exist, or apply them to specific works and eras. At their best, digital humanities projects are relevant. They address issues that people are interested in. They have the ability to be interpreted by a large variety of people based on gender, race, and other diverse experiences. They have the ability to evolve based on changing web interfaces, research methodologies, digital humanities guidelines, and the addition of new research. Their project teams are diverse and collaborative, with people of different specialties interacting with one another to form the most comprehensive project possible. They assign appropriate credit to everyone involved in the project where credit is due. They have the potential to be preserved throughout time, as well as be the starting point for additional research projects. Digital humanities projects are the future of humanities research. All it takes is an idea and the passion to take it to the next level.</p>
